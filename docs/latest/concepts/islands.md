Islands enable client side interactivity in Fresh. Islands are isolated Preact
components that are rendered on the client. This is different from all other
components in Fresh, as they are usually just rendered on the server.

Islands are defined by creating a file in the `islands/` folder in a Fresh
project. The name of this file must be a PascalCase or kebab-case name of the
island.

```tsx
// islands/MyIsland.tsx

import { useSignal } from "@preact/signals";

export default function MyIsland() {
  const count = useSignal(0);

  return (
    <div>
      Counter is at {count}.{" "}
      <button onClick={() => (count.value += 1)}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

An island can be used in a page like a regular Preact component. Fresh will take
care of automatically re-hydrating the island on the client.

Passing props to islands is supported, but only if the props are serializable.
Fresh can serialize the following types of values:

- Primitive types `string`, `boolean`, `bigint`, and `null`
- Most `number`s (`Infinity`, `-Infinity`, and `NaN` are silently converted to
  `null`)
- Plain objects with string keys and serializable values
- Arrays containing serializable values
- Uint8Array
- JSX Elements (restricted to `props.children`)
- Preact Signals (if the inner value is serializable)

Circular references are supported. If an object or signal is referenced multiple
times, it is only serialized once and the references are restored upon
deserialization. Passing complex objects like `Date`, custom classes, or
functions is not supported.

## Passing JSX to islands

Islands support passing JSX elements via the `children` property. This allows
you to pass static content rendered by the server to an island in the browser.

```jsx
// route/index.tsx
import MyIsland from "../islands/MyIsland.tsx";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <MyIsland>
      <p>This text is rendered on the server</p>
    </MyIsland>
  );
}
```

We can deduce which parts were rendered by the server and which parts where
rendered by an island from the HTML alone. It contains all the information we
need, which allows us to skip the work of having to send a serialized version of
`props.children` to the browser.

### Nesting islands

Islands can be nested within other islands as well. In that scenario they act
like a normal Preact component, but still receive the serialized props if any
were present.

```jsx
// route/index.tsx
import MyIsland from "../islands/my-island.tsx";
import OtherIsland from "../islands/other-island.tsx";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <MyIsland>
      <OtherIsland foo="this prop will be serialized">
        <p>This text is rendered on the server</p>
      </OtherIsland>
    </MyIsland>
  );
}
```

In essence, Fresh allows you to mix static and interactive parts in your app in
a way that's most optimal for your use app. We'll keep sending only the
JavaScript that is needed for the islands to the browser.

```jsx
// route/index.tsx
import MyIsland from "../islands/my-island.tsx";
import OtherIsland from "../islands/other-island.tsx";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <MyIsland>
      <div>
        <h1>Rendered by server</h1>
        <OtherIsland>
          <p>also rendered by server</p>
        </OtherIsland>
      </div>
    </MyIsland>
  );
}
```
